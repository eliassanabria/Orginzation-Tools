# Orginzation-Tools
Backups of my code for Organization Tools and YSA Tools Application that is being built.
# Purpose:
Organizations can struggle to communicate and get messages out, with the creation of Organization Tools, messages can be sent to people within an organization.
The creation of YSA Tools will utilize the Organization Tools Base code but will allow YSA Wards to communicate with each other, and know what apartments are in the ward as well as who lives in what apartment.

# Startup Application:
### Pitch:
Organization Tools will be a long-term project with expansions into various different applications.
For the startup application that will be used in CS 260, the sub-application will be geared towards church wards from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Particularly Singles wards (YSA and SA Wards) to help members get to know each other and communicate with each other.

YSA Tools will focus on:
* Ward Directory
