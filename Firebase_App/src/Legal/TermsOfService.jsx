        <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE AND USER AGREEMENT</h1><small>Updated 18 May 2023</small>
        <p>
            This Terms of Service and User Agreement ("Agreement") governs your access and use of the
            "Org Tools" software application ("App"), provided by Org Tools & Solutions Inc ("Company", "we", "us", "our").
            By accessing and using the App, you ("User", "you", "your") accept and agree to be bound by the terms and
            conditions contained in this Agreement.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Access and Use of the App</h2>
        <p>
            The App is provided free of charge for users belonging to an organization that subscribes to our
            "premium" paid subscription plan. In case of cancellation of any recurring subscriptions, you will retain
            access until the date of what would have been your next renewal.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Account Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            To delete your account, you must email us at support@orgtools.app. Account deletion requests are processed
            within 48 hours of acknowledgment of the request.
        </p>
        <h2>3. Sign-In with Google</h2>
        <p>
            Our App uses 'Sign in with Google'. By using this sign-in method, you also agree to Google's Terms of Service
            and Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Abuse of Platform</h2>
        <p>
            Abuse of our platform will not be tolerated. Users found to be in violation of this policy will be permanently banned.
        </p>
        <h2>5. Moderators and Confidential Information</h2>
        <p>
            Group Moderators are prohibited from storing confidential information within the App. Moderators found in violation
            of this rule will receive an email warning. After two such warnings, the violating account will be suspended for a
            period of one month. If the same offense is repeated post-suspension, the account will be permanently suspended.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Data Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            Our App collects data from a given organization for the purpose of conducting surveys. This data collection is strictly
            limited to survey questionnaires and must not solicit or gather confidential information.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Profanity and Use of Language</h2>
        <p>
            The use of profane language in any part of the application is strictly prohibited. Violations will result in warnings,
            and after five such warnings, the user's privileges will be restricted, disallowing the user from entering text in
            any fields visible to other users.
        </p>
        <h2>8. Text Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Our server will analyze all text for profanity and inappropriate language. If an exact match to a profane word is found,
            it will be replaced with special characters. Partial matches will be flagged for review by an employee of the Company.
        </p>
        <h2>9. Appeals</h2>
        <p>
            Users with suspended or banned accounts have 14 days and 30 days respectively to appeal by contacting support@orgtools.app.
        </p>
        <h2>10. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            We collect personal data on behalf of Group Moderators. Personal Identifying Information (PII) is visible only to the User,
            Moderators with credentials to view vitals, and Org Tools for record keeping.
        </p>
        <h2>11. Account Suspension and Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
            Users who wish to temporarily disable their accounts or request deletion of their personal data can do so by emailing
            support@orgtools.app.
        </p>
